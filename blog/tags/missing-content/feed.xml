				<description><![CDATA[<p>Since I've blown away all my old blog content, there are a lot of pages missing that were really useful. 
I'm going to bring the best of them back, and I have plans to actually rewrite some of the older ones to update them 
(part of the reason I let the old ones go is that some of them were so out-of-date that they might have been misleading).</p>

<p>If there is one or more of my old articles in particular that you'd like to see come back, please post a comment below!</p>]]></description>
